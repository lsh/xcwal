# XCWal
A script to use [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) colors with xcode.
This is still very much a work in progress, so your mileage may vary.
To run, make sure you have `pywal` installed and have a cached file already created.
So far, usage just looks like:
`git clone https://github.com/lsh/xcwal
cd xcwall
python xcwal.py`
